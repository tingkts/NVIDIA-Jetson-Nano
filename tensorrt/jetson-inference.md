- The [Transfer Learning with PyTorch](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference#training) section of the tutorial speaks from the perspective of running PyTorch onboard Jetson for training DNNs, however the same PyTorch code can be used on a PC, server, or cloud instance with an NVIDIA discrete GPU for faster training.
